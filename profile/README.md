## Hi there 👋

## What:
The Omphalos Project is the home of the next generation Modern Object Pascal compiler, libraries, tooling and IDE integrations.

## Why
The Object Pascal programming language is highly underrated and haven't been given the spotlight it deserves.
What might not be known to many, is that Object Pascal is still modern and capable of competing with the well known languages like C/C++ and latest Rust.
With the latter, Object Pascal already have safety features which makes it ideal to construct more safe software.
The Omphalos compiler aims to follow the Delphi dialect of Object Pascal and expand on this further by carefully adding valuable language extensions to the dialect and adding mechanisms to the compiler with further helps the developer writting better code.

Unlike Rust, Object Pascal has a clear, concises and easy to learn syntax which comes natural to developers and already at this point, help avoid the common mistakes made in a compiled language.

Besides the compiler iself, you'll also find libraries and tooling to support writing good and maintainable software, along with IDE integrations.

The compiler and supporting libraries will be released under a permissive license to facilitate and encourage usage in commercial software development without risking license compliance issues.
